# Varnish Cache Capabilities

A comprehensive demonstration of Varnish Cache's powerful VCL (Varnish Configuration Language) features for high-performance HTTP acceleration and edge computing.

## Overview

This repository showcases advanced Varnish Cache configurations that demonstrate its capabilities beyond basic HTTP caching. It provides production-ready examples that illustrate Varnish's flexibility as a multi-purpose edge computing platform.

## Features

- **Intelligent Routing**: Direct traffic to appropriate backend servers based on URL patterns, headers, and client properties
- **Advanced Caching Strategies**: Content-specific TTLs, cache invalidation techniques, and selective caching rules
- **Authentication & Security**: Basic auth implementation, JWT validation, IP allowlisting, and rate limiting
- **Request/Response Manipulation**: Header modification, URL normalization, and content transformation
- **Load Balancing**: Backend health checks and traffic distribution using directors
- **Performance Optimisation**: Cookie handling, compression, and streaming for large objects
- **Edge Logic**: Device detection, geo-routing, and A/B testing capabilities
- **Monitoring & Debugging**: Detailed logging and debug header injection

## Repository Contents

- `default.vcl` - Main VCL file demonstrating comprehensive capabilities

## Requirements

- Varnish Cache 6.0.x or newer
- VMOD dependencies:
  - `std` (included in Varnish)
  - `directors` (included in Varnish)

## Quick Start

1. Install Varnish Cache:
   ```bash
   apt-get install varnish  # Debian/Ubuntu
   # or
   yum install varnish      # CentOS/RHEL
   ```

2. Install required VMODs:
   ```bash
   apt-get install varnish-modules  # Most standard modules
   ```

3. Deploy the configuration:
   ```bash
   cp default.vcl /etc/varnish/default.vcl
   systemctl restart varnish
   ```

## Configuration Guide

The main VCL file demonstrates:

| Feature | Section | Description |
|---------|---------|-------------|
| Backend Definition | Top | Multiple backend servers with health checks |
| Access Control | ACL | IP-based access restrictions |
| Authentication | `authenticate_user` | Basic auth implementation |
| Rate Limiting | `vcl_recv` | Request rate controls by client/endpoint |
| Caching Rules | `vcl_backend_response` | TTL definitions by content type |
| Device Detection | `detect_device` | Mobile vs desktop handling |
| Error Handling | `vcl_synth` | Custom JSON error responses |

## Performance Considerations

This configuration is designed to showcase capabilities rather than optimise for a specific workload. When adapting for production:

- Adjust backend connection parameters based on your origin servers' capacity
- Fine-tune TTLs according to your content update frequency
- Optimise memory allocation in `vcl_init` based on expected traffic patterns
- Consider backend-specific configurations for heterogeneous infrastructure
